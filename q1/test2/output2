In the following code we will run 3 functions that implement the functions strcmp, strncmp, strchr.
For the my_strcmp function we will receive 2 strings.
For the my_strncmp function we will also receive a number n.
For the my_strchr function we will receive a character c and check if it appears in the first string that was entered.

Enter string 1:
Enter string 2:
Enter n (used for my_strncmp):
Enter c (used for my_strchr):

/*** my_strcmp results ***/
Hello is greater than Hella

/*** my_strncmp results ***/
Hello is equal to Hella for the first 3 characters

/*** my_strchr results ***/
The index of l in Hello is 2
